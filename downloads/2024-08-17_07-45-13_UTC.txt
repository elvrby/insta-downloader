The Tesla Cybertruck is a futuristic electric vehicle with a bold, angular design made from Ultra-Hard 30X Cold-Rolled stainless steel, which Elon Musk claims is bulletproof. Itâ€™s available in three configurations: Single Motor RWD, Dual Motor AWD, and Tri-Motor AWD, offering 0-60 mph times from 6.5 seconds to under 2.9 seconds, and a range of up to 500 miles.

The truck is designed for heavy-duty tasks, with a towing capacity of up to 14,000 pounds and a payload capacity of 3,500 pounds. It features adaptive air suspension and a minimalist interior with a large touchscreen.

Prices start at around $39,900, with production expected to begin in 2024. The Cybertruck is set to compete with other electric trucks like the Rivian R1T and Ford F-150 Lightning, standing out due to its unique design and Teslaâ€™s reputation. #funny #memes
